                        <p class="lead">In our dataset, there is information on population height, literacy, infant mortality, etc... that correlate with each other in interesting ways. Our goal will be to predict the wealth of nations, which will be measured in GDP per capita. Looking at same characteristics of the dataset, the GDP per capita ranges from $500 to $55,100 and has a standard deviation of $9834</p>

                        <p class="lead">First, we created a correlation table to see how different features correlated with the wealth of nations. Some surprising results were that the number of phones per hundred people and male height in cm were highly correlated with GDP per capita. Meanwhile, birthrate and infant mortality were highly negatively correlated</p>

                        <p class="lead">Here we have a confusion matrix with the results of the linear regression applied on our testing dataset. A confusion matrix for a classification problem tells us the number of correct and incorrect predictions for every class (for example wealthy). For example, the model may have classified 10 countries with average GDP as average and classified 2 countries with average GDP incorrectly, shown in the below confusion matrix. Linear regression performed exceptionally well on countries with average GDP.</p>

                        <p class="lead">By calculating the total correct examples over all examples classified, we get an average accuracy of around 58%. Mean absolute error, or the average difference between predicted and actual GDP per capita, was $3299</p>
